## Description

Application provides a web-based interface for exchanging/converting money from one currency to another currency. Online exchange rates. Parsing of exchange rates occurs every time the application is turned on. I will improve the application as much as possible.
To accomplish that 3 main Modules:
* Localiztion properties (UI). Supports 3 language (en, ru, tr).
* Model
    - Currency -> creates an entity and initializes based on the parser
    - Parser -> parse exchange rates for any currency
* Window where the UI is discribed with localization and model
